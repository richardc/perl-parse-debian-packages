Description: "Three-dimensional" desktop switcher
 3D-Desktop is an OpenGL program for switching virtual desktops in
 a seamless 3-dimensional manner.  The current desktop is mapped into a
 fullscreen 3D environment where you may choose other screens.  Several
 different visualization modes are available.  A window manager
 compatible with the GNOME pager standard is required.
 .
 The transition from working desktop to fullscreen 3D environment is
 seamless: when the pager activates you see your current desktop appear
 to zoom out to a point in space where you can see your other virtual
 desktops allowing you to select another.
 .
 The program is rather memory-hungry and it is CPU intensive, but it's
 accessible from the command line, which makes it perfect for show
 floors and impressing your non-UN*X-using friends.

Description: 3Dwm applications
 The 3Dwm clock application (tdwm-clock) is the first real application
 that is even remotely useful. It makes use of the 3Dwm Nobel API, including
 the new solid modeling support, to create a three-dimensional analog clock
 displaying the current time.
 .
 3Dwm is the Three-Dimensional Workspace Manager. It defines a full user
 environment with support for three-dimensional user interfaces using a 3D

Description: 3Dwm geometry client example
 This is a very simple 3Dwm client that connects to the exported GeometryKit
 in the server, creates a Geometry, loads a 3D file from the local system and
 passes it to the 3Dwm server.
 .
 The 3Dwm server will happily render any geometry that is created, so
 running geoclient several times will add more geometries to the graphical
 output. Please note that you may need to zoom out (using the 'X' key) to
 see graphical output.
 .
 The geoclient is able to open native .raw files as well as standard 3ds
 files (using MeshIO). In other words, you may experiment by loading other
 files than the supplied office model to the 3Dwm server.

 graphical output will be displayed on a single quad in the 3Dwm world (you
 may need to zoom out to see it). Currently, vncclient supports no interaction
 with the VNC window (the bindings and the actual communication code have been
 implemented, only the 3Dwm side is missing).
